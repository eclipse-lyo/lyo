There are currently two Perl OSLC client libraries in the Eclipse Lyo project contributed by different individuals.   At this time, both libraries will exist side-by-side.   The project will gather feedback and determine how to best move them forward.

Lyo::OSLC is a Perl OSLC ChangeManagement client developed with samples for accessing IBM Rational Team Concert and IBM Rational ClearQuest providers

Net::OSLC::CM is a generic Perl OSLC ChangeManagement client and has been tested with the Lyo OSLC adapter for Bugzilla.
