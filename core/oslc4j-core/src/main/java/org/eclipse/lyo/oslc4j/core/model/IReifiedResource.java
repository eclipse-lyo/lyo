/**
 * This interface helps model RDF reified statements in plain old Java objects.
 * OSLC commonly uses reification to describe metadata on links, such as labels.
 * The {@link #getValue()} and {@link #setValue(Object)} methods allow you to
 * set the actual object of the triple. All other properties in implementing
 * classes are statements about the statement. These additional properties
 * should have {@link org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core.annotation.OslcName OslcName} and {@link org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core.annotation.OslcPropertyDefinition OSLCPropertyDefinition} annotations.
 * See {@link Link} for an example.
 * <p>
 * Note: The parameterized type T must be a {@link java.net.URI URI} to serialize to JSON due
 * to current limitations in the OSLC JSON format.
