/**
 * This interface provides a way to add custom prefixes at runtime. As it is
 * used inside the {@link OslcSchema} annotation, <b>every time</b> that this annotation 
 * is read during the response writing it is also checked for a class definition in 
 * the {@link OslcSchema#customNamespaceProvider()} field and if there is a concrete 
 * implementation of this interface, a new instance of this implementation will be created 
 * and the {@link #getCustomNamespacePrefixes()} invoked.
 * 
 * All values obtained will be added to the namespace prefix list, thereafter used in 
 * the response writing. Note that if the {@link #getCustomNamespacePrefixes()} map, hereafter 
 * called customMap, contains keys that are equal to the ones defined in 
 * {@link OslcSchema#value()}, the customMap's key=value will take precedence over the others.
