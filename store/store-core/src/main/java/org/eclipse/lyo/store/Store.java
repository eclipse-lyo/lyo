/**
 * Store is the main interface for operations on OSLC Resources with the backing
 * triplestore. Please use {@link StoreFactory} to instantiate concrete implementations.
 * <p>
 * <p>The store is designed to be used for storing individual {@link IResource}s or
 * unordered sets of them (due to how triplestores work).</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Resources are stored under a specific named graph similar to how the keys are used in the
 * {@link java.util.Map}. That is, a <em>unique named graph</em> must be supplied to store a
 * (group of)
 * resource(s) under the same <em>named graph</em> in the triplestore. The named graph is
 * expected to be
 * a valid {@link URI}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>In the case of an individual resource, you can use the resource's <em>about URI</em> as the
 * <code>namedGraph</code>.</p>
 * <p>
 * Example uses:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>store.containsKey(resource.getAbout().toString())</code> - returns whether a
 * resource is stored under its named graph URI</li>
 * <li><code>store.putResources(resource.getAbout().toString(), resource)</code> - store the
 * resource under the namedGraph that corresponds to the <em>about URI</em> of the resource.
 * Equivalent
 * of <code>store.putResource(resource)</code></li>
 * <li><code>store.putResources(serviceProviderId, resources)</code> - store all resources
 * managed by a given Service Provider, under a named graph identified by the
 * <code>serviceProviderId</code> URI. This assumes that the
 * <code>serviceProviderId</code> is a
 * valid URI.</li>
 * </ul>
