    <title>Lyo Store overview</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the <em>Lyo Store</em> project overview.</p>

<p>Lyo Store is a project that is intended to assist the developer that mainly deals with {@link
    org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core.model.AbstractResource} in their daily line of
    work and wants to put RDF representations of those objects into the triplestore.</p>

<p>In order to be able to insert those objects into the triplestore, they need to have the correct annotations on the
    class and property level. It is possible to do it manually, refer to the annotation interfaces defined under
    <code>org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core.annotation</code>. Better still, you can <a
        href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/ToolchainModellingAndCodeGenerationWorkshop">use Lyo Toolchain to graphically
        model the domain and automatically generate OSLC4J-compliant Java code</a>.
</p>

<p>The main part of this project is the {@link org.eclipse.lyo.store.Store} interface. You can instantiate concrete implementations of this
    interface using the {@link org.eclipse.lyo.store.StoreFactory} class.</p>
